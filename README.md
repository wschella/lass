# BIG-bench Assessors

This repo contains the code for the experiments regarding building assessor models[1] from the enormous pile of evaluation data generated by BIG-bench[2].

## Setup

- Since we have BIG-bench as a submodule, clone this repo with `git clone --recursive <url>`
- Make sure Git LFS is installed.
- `cd bigbench; git lfs install; git lfs pull`
- Initialize Conda environment.yml
- `poetry install`
- Decompress all instance data with `./scripts/decompress.sh` (UNIX only, requires `parallel` to be installed.)
